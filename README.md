# substrate-light-ui

Light client focused user interface for the Polkadot and Substrate networks. It is currently being built as an Electron app, and will be migrated to a web app once wasm compilation of the Substrate Light node is available.

## Overview

This is the repository for Substrate light client's user interface. The light-ui is meant to be an intuitive interface for beginner users to easily be able to interact with the main components of various Substrate chains.

As of now, the main functions are as follows, in order of priority:

* Identity management - manage accounts and addresses, including ability to create, edit, restore, backup, and forget them.

* Transfer balance - send and receive funds in the currency of the relevant substrate chain.

* Staking/Nominating/Voting democracy - stake tokens, nominate validators, and vote for proposals regarding the the current chain.

## Build from sources

### Dependencies

Make sure you have [yarn >= 1.13.0](http://yarnpkg.com/) and [nodejs >= 10.10.0](https://nodejs.org/en/).

**IMPORTANT.** For now, you also need to have an instance of [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) running locally on your machine, exposing a WebSocket on its default port 127.0.0.1:9944. We plan of course to bundle Substrate into the Electron app very soon, see [#52](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-light-ui/issues/52).

### Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-light-ui
cd ./substrate-light-ui
yarn install
```

### Build this repo and run

```bash
yarn electron
```

### Build binaries

This command takes more time than the previous, but it'll produce a fully standalone binary.

```bash
yarn package
```

### Run with live reload for development

```bash
yarn start
```

### Run Substrate Locally (https://substrate.readme.io/)
In development it can be useful to have a local dev instance of Substrate running. You can do this by running:
```
curl https://getsubstrate.io -sSf | bash
```
to get the latest Substrate (it is a fast moving project and things break a lot so if you find things are breaking on master, make sure you're not running a very outdated version).

To run it:
```
substrate --dev
```
## Contributing
We welcome any and all contributions whether it is in the form of raising an issue, filing a PR, or participating in the discussions. Please read the [Contributing Docs](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

> Troubleshooting: If it hangs on a white screen in Electron even though it has compiled and has been syncing for a long time, then simply choose 'View > Reload' (CMD + R on macOS) from the Electron menu. If the menu is not shown in the tray, then by clicking the Electron window and then holding down the ALT key to reveal it.
