# electron-app

Build an Electron application, using `electron-webpack` and `electron-builder`.

## How it works

### `yarn build`

This command assumes that we've built a CRA app inside `packages/light-apps`. It will copy the built files into electron-webpack's `static/` folder, and tell Electron to serve these files.

### `yarn start`

Runs `electron-webpack dev`, which tells Electron to load http://localhost:3000, which is most likely the port on which CRA's dev mode runs. It reloads Electron on any code change inside the electron codebase.

## Electron Security Checklist:
https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/security#1-only-load-secure-content

Inspired by: https://github.com/paritytech/fether/pull/451

#### Cheatsheet
1. Only Load Secure Content (https/wss/ftps over http/ws/ftp)
2. Disable Node.js Integration for Remote Content
  * Prevents XSS attacks from escalating to a Remote Code Execution Attack - limits the attack surface to the renderer process.
  * **Node Integration + XSS in renderer process = RCE**
  <pre>
    const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
      webPreferences: {
        nodeIntegration: false,
        nodeIntegrationInWorker: false,
        preload: path.join(app.getAppPath(), 'preload.js')
      }
    });
  </pre>
  * Good: instead of allowing full access to the Node API (including stuff like fs, io, etc.), only export necessary features via a preload script, making sure to validate arguments properly.

  **N.B. SLUI: preload not necessary, as there's no need for main<->renderer communication (yet)**
3. Context Isolation - separates Javascript contexts between preload scripts and the page's scripts, and between Electon's internal scripts and the page's scripts, preventing so-called "Prototype Pollution Attacks", i.e. extra protection against RCE's.
  * `contextIsolation` is false by default.
  * this means by default, you have shared context between the preload scripts and the page's scripts, i.e. `window.variable` set in `preload.js` is defined in the `BrowserWindow`'s context.

  **N.B. SLUI: again not a concern considering we don't need preload scripts at all, but good to keep in mind.**
4. Handle Session Permission Requests from Remote Content
  * The default setting in Electron is to approve all permission requests unless the developer explicitly tells it to handle it a particular way.
  **N.B. SLUI: only some permissions matter in our context.**
  Required Permissions:
  ```
    contentSettings
    debugger: only Dev.
    desktopCapture: only Dev.
    fileBrowserHandler: This is needed for JSON File Recovery.
    idle: It could be a useful security measure in case user is AFK
    notifications: Yes - extend from Alerts.
  ```

  * Electron implements the same types of permissions as Chromium as listed below:
  ```
    activeTab: we don't use tabs
    alarms: not needed
    background: not needed
    bookmarks: not needed
    browsingData: not needed
    certificateProvider: yes
    clipboardRead: no
    clipboardWrite: no
    contentSettings: only allow https, ftps, wss
    contextMenus: no
    cookies: no
    debugger: not needed in production, only in development environment.
    declarativeContent
    declarativeNetRequest: cannot see a need to block or redirect network requests ATOW.
    declarativeWebRequest: cannot see a need to block or redirect network requests ATOW.
    desktopCapture: disable in Production, enable in Development.
    displaySource: no.
    dns: no.
    documentScan: no
    downloads: no.
    enterprise.deviceAttributes: no.
    enterprise.hardwarePlatform: no.
    enterprise.platformKeys: no.
    experimental: no.
    fileBrowserHandler: This is needed for JSON File Recovery.
    fileSystemProvider: no need
    fontSettings: no need
    gcm: no need
    geolocation: definitely no need for this.
    history: no need | using react router
    identity: no need
    idle: It could be a useful security measure in case user is AFK
    management: no need
    nativeMessaging: no need
    networking.config: no need
    notifications: Yes.
    pageCapture: no need
    platformKeys: no need.
    power: no need.
    printerProvider: no need.
    privacy: no need.
    processes: no.
    proxy: no.
    sessions: no.
    signedInDevices: no.
    storage: no.
    system.cpu: no
    system.display: no
    system.memory: no
    system.storage: no
    tabCapture: no.
    tabs: no need
    topSites: no
    tts: nice for accessibility in the future but honestly probably not necessary.
    ttsEngine: nice for accessibility in the future but honestly probably not necessary.
    unlimitedStorage
    vpnProvider: no
    wallpaper: not needed
    webNavigation: no
    webRequest: no
    webRequestBlocking: no
  ```
5. Do Not Disable WebSecurity (default) - self explanatory
6. Define a Content Security Policy - not relevant (yet) as we're not loading any external web pages
7. Do Not Set allowRunningInsecureContent to true (default) - self explanatory
8. Do Not Enable Experimental Features (default) - self explanatory
9. Do Not Use enableBlinkFeatures (default) - self explanatory
10. Do Not Use allowpopups (default) - self explanatory
11. Verify WebView Options Before Creation:
  * A WebView created in the renderer process will always create its own renderer process using its own `webPreferences`.
  ```
    app.on('web-contents-created', (event, contents) => {
      contents.on('will-attach-webview', (event, webPreferences, params) => {
        // Strip away preload scripts if unused or verify their location is legitimate
        delete webPreferences.preload
        delete webPreferences.preloadURL

        // Disable Node.js integration
        webPreferences.nodeIntegration = false

        // Verify URL being loaded
        if (!params.src.startsWith('https://example.com/')) {
          event.preventDefault()
        }
      })
    })
  ```
  **N.B. SLUI: we don't load any webpages, and if we do in the future it'll be in a browser so this is not a concern.**
12. Disable or limit navigation
```
  const URL = require('url').URL

  app.on('web-contents-created', (event, contents) => {
    contents.on('will-navigate', (event, navigationUrl) => {
      const parsedUrl = new URL(navigationUrl)

      if (parsedUrl.origin !== 'https://example.com') {
        event.preventDefault()
      }
    })
  })
```
**N.B. SLUI: While not used yet, we may in the future want to navigate to the api docs page, or the forum, or other substrate related sites.**

13. Disable or limit creation of new windows
```
const { shell } = require('electron')

app.on('web-contents-created', (event, contents) => {
  contents.on('new-window', (event, navigationUrl) => {
    // if somehow there is a new-window event, block it.
    event.preventDefault()
  })
})
```
**N.B. SLUI: we just need the one BrowserWindow**
14. Do not use openExternal with untrusted content
15. Disable the remote module: the `remote` module would allow the renderer process to access APIs normally only available in the main process.
```
  const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
    webPreferences: {
      enableRemoteModule: false
    }
  })
```
16. Filter the remote module: relevant only if we cannot disable remote module.
